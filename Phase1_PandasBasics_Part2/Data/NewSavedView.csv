Oh. My. God. This place was awesome! Not only did it have the widest choice of options I have ever seen at a buffet, the quality and presentation was like a top restaurant!

Highly recommend going here if you're after a good feed. Plenty of healthy choices as well but I must admit I gave in to quite a few of those tasty pastries... :)",1,wcKvC0jov-kAHg-GIvWJqg

Although I do not eat any kind of seafood I have to say they have the best selection of crab. They had the Alaskan King crab and the snow crab in buckets! This place is like crab heaven if you like crab. They have melted butter that you can scoop up to your hearts content and they have champagne in a glass now not in those cheapy plastic containers they do in other casinos. I like the salad selection and of course the choices in bread. I do not eat bread although I love bread because of the high carb content but enough about that. The bread had to be tried! It was delicious, and they had real butter on the side. Soft butter, not the frozen kind. The butter was at room temperature so it was easy to spread it on your bread. Yum! 

Alright downside to this place is you have to be ready to wait. It felt like a line at Disneyland to get into one of those rides! The line was long! We waited 75 minutes to be seated and we stayed for 2 hours inside. Prepare to wait folks. It is worth the wait but do not come here starving hungry because you will wait and you will end up grouchy and impatient by the time you get to the cashier. Eat enough for about an hour wait and then be ready to feast! Happy eating1",0,qr9hmaIxq1z9ycgT28PpRw

King crab and snow crab are on the menu but they are served cold and almost frozen.  Louisiana casino buffets actually steam their crabs which I believe taste better.  Everything else on the buffet was just nasty or below standards in taste.  If it wasn't for the crabs, I'd give this place a 1 star.

Seems like all Vegas buffets suffer from the same disease, they are large in square footage but small in selections and high in price.  They are built for flash.",0,C7IrOaBaxd7tYyFnb4b-lw

We arrived at 1100 and finally got through the long line around 1200. I was pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness, huge variety of the food, and drinks. There is a little bit of everything from meats, pastas, seafood, salads, pizzas, breads, fruits, breakfast items (omlet station, pancakes/waffles, warm maple syrup, thick slabs of bacon, red potatoes, and sausage-SO YUMMY!!!!) and desserts!!! Champage/mimosas were optional for a small extra charge and the orange juice tasted like it was freshly squeezed. My favorites were the large cocktail shrimp, prime rib, ham, turkey, sea bass/salmon, coos coos, sushi, eggs bennidict, and the best cherry danishes that I've ever had!!!! The fresh fruit was amazingly sweet and ripe especially the strawberries, cantaloupe, and watermelon. The waitress was attentive and checked on our table often. We tried everything and I wasn't disappointed with anything. My daughter is 8 and can be a picky eater, but even she was in  pure heavan with the selections. For 3 people we spent $98.00 and it was worth every penny!!! We'll defiantly be back!",0,MVj_1U4D5h7iDtu5TG0d2Q
